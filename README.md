# MZSlider
Custom UISlider subclass that you can modify and use in your projects.

I've used custom UISlider in a lot of my iOS projects. Almost always the UI design and what client wants are completelly different than the default iOS Controls. You can use images to get the custom effect, but most often the developers try to avoid this and create the look in code in order to avoid multiple png's in the code.
